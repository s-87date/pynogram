# Here used the simple format for defining nonograms:
#
# If the line starts with a '#' or ';' it's ignored.
# Also if the '#' or ';' becomes at the middle of the line,
# the rest of the line is also becomes a comment.
#
# The colors definitions are listed in [colors] section
# (skipped in black-and-white nonograms) in the following format:
# <COLOR NAME> = (<COLOR_DESC>) <ASCII CHARACTER>
# COLOR_DESC should be one of the following:
# 1) common color name, recognized by SVG like 'red'
#    (http://www.december.com/html/spec/colorsvg.html)
# 2) RGB-triplet like (89, 11, 255)
# 3) hexadecimal color code like 88CC44
# e.g:
#
# [colors]
# p = (pink) %
# g = (0, 255, 0) *
# r = (FF0000) &
#
#
# The clues (nonogram description) listed in the [clues] section
# on one or more lines, separated by COMMA and/or NEWLINE.
#
# Inside the block of columns or rows the empty (comment) lines can appear
# to visually break the long series of descriptions
# (split by blocks of 5 lines for example).
#
# You could enclose the description in a single or double quotes
# and the line can ends with the ',' (that is common if the descriptions
# copied from source code).
#
# For the colored puzzles you have to suffix the block length with the
# color name defined above like that:
# '2g 1r 2' stands for the row of
# 1) 2-block of 'g' color
# 2) 1-block of 'r' color
# 3) 2-block of default color (black)

# FULL EXAMPLE:
#
# # # # # # # # 5.txt # # # # # # #
# [clues]                         #
# columns=3 1,1 1 1,1 1 1,1 3     #
# rows=4,1,4,1,4                  #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
#
# That is the most compact way to
# define the board with the '5' digit:
#
#      X X X X
#      X
#      X X X X
#            X
#      X X X X
#
# If you want to be more verbose you could define the same board as following:
#
# # # # # # 5-verbose.txt # # # # #
# # The '5' digit as a nonogram   #
#                                 #
