# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.0.3] - 2018-01-11
### Added
- Initial release!
- Solve the black-and-white nonograms using several methods
- Print out the solving process on the console or the web-page (SVG)

## [0.1.0] - 2018-01-12
### Fixed
- examples distribution

## [0.1.1] - 2018-01-18
### Added
- color puzzles solver

## [0.1.2] - 2018-01-30
### Added
- choose the renderer in URL
- compress the page with gzip
- documentation with examples and references

### Fixed
- requirements for python3 (futures)
- suppress any WARNING by default (use -v)

### Removed
- demo boards
- lxml dependency (use standard XML parser)

## [0.2.0] - 2018-05-19
### Added
- adapt [Ben-Gurion University solver (BGU)](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~benr/nonograms/) for better line solver
- searching-backtracking algorithm
- support for pypy (both 2 and 3). This significantly improved
the performance of terminal-based solver. However, the web version
becomes more unresponsive on any pypy interpreter, so it's recommended
to use py3 for `pynogram-web` and pypy3 for `pynogram`
- use numpy for black and white boards if available
- read local PBN-formatted puzzles
- use tornado log formatter if tornado package is available
- statistics on the most time-consuming boards (webpbn.com). See docs/benchmarks.md for details
- show the search tree at the end of solving difficult puzzles
- [Faase](http://www.iwriteiam.nl/D0601.html#3) (one of the most difficult known board) and [n-dom](http://webpbn.com/survey/dom.html) boards
- list of local boards to the web UI (_/board/local/_, _/board/local/source_)
- test for colored SVG puzzle

### Fixed
- improved some bottlenecks by profiling:
  - commenting some debug logs
  - add \_\_slots\_\_
  - do as less as possible type conversions (set to list to tuple, etc)
  - replace string color names in `ColoredBoard.cells` with their integer codes
- use named tuples `CellPosition` and `CellState`
instead of pairs and triples
- do not manipulate `Board.cells` directly anymore, use helper methods now
- [cache is more intelligent now](http://webpbn.com/survey/caching.html)
- refactor the Simpson line solver
- flake8 now checks everything


## [0.2.1] - 2018-06-01
### Added
- new visualization mode `--curses` (Linux only)
- `--show-examples-folder` to find folder with embedded puzzles

### Fixed
- issues with Unicode on Windows console
- specify ubuntu version in travis CI

### Updated
- improved README: more examples and descriptions
- more clear rendering in text-grid mode
- add PyPy in setup.py
- gif image examples (to mirror recent algorithm accelerations)


## [0.3.0] - 2018-08-30
### Added
- colors are single-numbers now (not sets): HUGE performance gains
- http://nonograms.org puzzles parse and solve
- another 'efficient' solver.
Based on the work ['An Efficient Approach to Solving Nonograms'](
https://ir.nctu.edu.tw/bitstream/11536/22772/1/000324586300005.pdf)
- trim off already solved lines before backtracking
- reduce color board to equivalent black-and-white before backtracking (if possible)
- SVG renderer draws color clues
- pylint in CI
- new hard puzzle in local collection:
[LalaFrogKK](https://github.com/CGI-LAB/Nonogram/blob/master/PuzzleCannotSolve.txt)
- minor support for blotted puzzles parsing

### Fixed
- set US locale to correctly show non-ASCII boxes in --curses mode
- reduce refresh pause in --curses mode
- unsuppressed pylint warnings
- correctly install dependencies with `python setup.py test`

### Updated
- massive refactoring: move things around
- solvers have common ancestor now
- board refactoring: made an hierarchy to separate methods
- reduce backtracking logs
- optimize benchmarks slightly
- more verbose requirements.txt
- multiple imports now made on separate lines
- replace " with ' whenever possible
- replace '%s' with %r
- remove irrelevant benchmarks results
- more readable README
- more references in README
- [codebeat](https://codebeat.co) badge
